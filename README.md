### Hi there 👋

🎓 My name is Anthony Ma, and I am currently enrolled at Cornell University purusing my Bachelor's in Information Sciences with a concentration in Data Science.

🏬 This past summer, I completed an internship at AT&T Labs in Middletown, New Jersey, where I worked on various tasks related to Large Language Models, including data generation and augmentation, and fine-tuning using Axolotl. I was also able to dip my toes in various other projects that my coworkers were developing over the course of the internship. Last year, I worked part-time for CGeneTool, a small biotech equipment reseller, and I am developing automated programs for consolidation of client records and trend analysis of the market for used biotech equipment. I have also completed 100 projects using Python as a part of an online Udemy course. I don't currently have many contributions on Github, as I don't really use it for my projects, but I'm hoping to get involved in the near future.

🔭 I have learned various skills such as Python, Natural Language Processing, web scraping, HTML and CSS, SQL, and statistical analysis.

🎮 Outside of coding and data science, I enjoy playing video games. The games I am currently playing the most are League of Legends, Elden Ring, Honkai: Star Rail, and Monster Hunter Rise. I am also a custom keyboard enthusiast and an audiophile, and I play the cello on the side.
