### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently enrolled at Cornell University as an Information Sciences major with a concentration in Data Science. I am taking a leave of absence, and I plan to return to campus for the Fall 2023 semester. This profile is meant to display some of the projects I've worked on that demonstrate my abilities related to Python programming and my major. I will update the notna2435 repository regularly as I complete more projects in the future.
